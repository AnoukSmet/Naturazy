# **Naturazy**
## **Description** 
The goal for this project is to create an appealing website for Naturazy, a bed & breakfast in the middle of the nature. 
The target audience is couples of all ages who want to go on a getaway, away from their busy (city) lives, in order to relax in the nature. 
The site needs to be visually appealing so potential guests feel the need to go there in order to unwind. 
An intuitive user experience is key here so that the visitors find all the necessary information easily. 

This project is part of my course to become a Full Stack Developer. 
This will be my first project for which I will use HTML & CSS in order to create a static, responsive website.

### **User Stories**
1. As a user I want that the website of a potential b&b to speak to my emotions right away.
I need to have the feeling that I don't want to miss out on the amazing experience. 
Pictures are for me the most convincing. I expect to see pictures of the rooms, property in general but also of the environment.
I would also like to have the possibility to get in touch with the property through the website. 

1. When I'm looking for my next holiday, I want the website to be easy to navigate. 
I also like to know a bit of information about the owners as a b&b experience is much more personal than going to a hotel. 
After reading about the propery and the owners, I want clear information about when I can do the check-in, check-out and the costs for breakfast and parking. 

1. When I choose a place to spend my valuable free time, I let myself be guided by experiences of others. Testimonials and guest reviews are the most important for me.
This in combination with appealing images really thrives my decision-making process. Links to social media like facebook, tripadvisor etc are key.

1. As an older person who is not the best with technology, it is very important that the website is easy and simple to use. I have just learned how to use a tablet so it's important that the website functions well on tablets.
The more intuitive the website is, the more likely I will be to book the property. I like to make a reservation directly with the property so I don't want to have to look too long in order to find the contact details of the property.

### **Design Choices**
As the property is located in the middle of the nature, I made all my design choices based on natural colors & elements.
I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors.co") and [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/) to come up with a color scheme that fits the overall feeling of nature.

<a></a>
#### Fonts
In order to find appropriate fonts for my website, I have visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the various options.
For the overall content I have decided to use the [Fanwood Text](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fanwood+Text?query=fanw "Google fonts: Fanwood Text") font. In my opinion this font is easy to read and visually appealing.
For my headings I decided to go with a different font in order to make them stand out from the main content. The font I chose for this, is the [Eagle Lake](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Eagle+Lake?query=eagle "Google Fonts: Eagle Lake") font.
This is a calligraphic font that highlights to heading and gives it a more personal feeling. 

<a></a>
#### Icons
I have decided to implement icons, using the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). The icons that I chose are self explanatory and are in line with the overall feeling of the website.
I will make sure that the icons are styled according to the website. I will use the icons mainly in the navigation bar in order to make it more appealing. The navigation icons will disappear when viewing on a mobile in order to keep it clear.
The navigation menu will transform into a hamburger icon to make it more simple to use on mobile.

<a></a>
#### Colors
As mentioned before, I based my color scheme on the natural aspect of the property. 
You can view my color scheme [here](https://colorhunt.co/palette/193637).
Below I will explain more why I choose the various colors and for what I will be using them.


* #3C5D4B: This color will be used as my primary background-color. It is a dark green color (referring to trees, plants) which creates a calm, natural feeling. 
* #A1BAAF: This color is a slightly ligher green which I will use for my navigation menu and call-to-action buttons.
* #F6FFF8: This color will be used as text color for the overall contact of the page. It's a mint cream (off white) which stands out well to the background colors that I have chosen.
* #39210C: This is a seal brown color which represents the wood in nature. I will use this color as text-color for my navigation & buttons. 

I have used to contract checker on Coolors in order to make sure that the contract is sufficient.
This way my content will be easily readable. 

<a></a>
#### Structure
I have chosen to use [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create an overall structure for my website. 
Bootstrap provides various elements of CSS and Javascript which is very helpful to keep a good structure on your page. 
As Bootstrap4 is designed for mobile first, I will be certain that my website functions well on mobile.

## **Wireframes**
I have decided to use [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create wireframes for my website. 
First I created a basic wireframe for desktop and later on for tablet and mobile. 
For my website I have decided to go for a 1 page website which suits more with the current trends. 
The website will be easy to navigate by using the navigation bar or by scrolling down the page. 

You can view my wireframes [here](https://balsamiq.cloud/sc2gxvm/plfcf7k/r2278).

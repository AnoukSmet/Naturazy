# Naturazy
## Description 
The goal for this project is to create an appealing website for Naturazy, a bed & breakfast in the middle of the nature. 
The target audience is couples of all ages who want to go on a getaway, away from their busy (city) lives, in order to relax in the nature. 
The site needs to be visually appealing so potential guests feel the need to go there in order to unwind. 
An intuitive user experience is key here so that the visitors find all the necessary information easily. 

This project is part of my course to become a Full Stack Developer. 
This will be my first project for which I will use HTML & CSS in order to create a static, responsive website.

### User Stories
1. As a user I want that the website of a potential b&b to speak to my emotions right away.
I need to have the feeling that I don't want to miss out on the amazing experience. 
Pictures are for me the most convincing. 
I would also like to have the possibility to get in touch with the property through the website.

# Naturazy
## Description 
The goal for this project is to create an appealing website for Naturazy, a bed & breakfast in the middle of the nature. 
The target audience is couples of all ages who want to go on a getaway, away from their busy (city) lives, in order to relax in the nature. 
The site needs to be visually appealing so potential guests feel the need to go there in order to unwind. 
An intuitive user experience is key here so that the visitors find all the necessary information easily. 

This project is part of my course to become a Full Stack Developer. 
This will be my first project for which I will use HTML & CSS in order to create a static, responsive website.

* A website filled with valuable content
* Website should be easy to use on desktop, tablet & mobile
* Appealing visual elements
* Personal info about property & owners
* Website with creative call-to-actions
* Offer social proof like testimonials & guest reviews
* Contact details should be easy to find
* Form to contact owners directly from site

### User Stories
1. As a user I want that the website of a potential b&b to speak to my emotions right away.
I need to have the feeling that I don't want to miss out on the amazing experience. 
Pictures are for me the most convincing. I expect to see pictures of the rooms, property in general but also of the environment.
I would also like to have the possibility to get in touch with the property through the website. 

1. When I'm looking for my next holiday, I want the website to be easy to navigate. 
I also like to know a bit of information about the owners as a b&b experience is much more personal than going to a hotel. 
After reading about the propery and the owners, I want clear information about when I can do the check-in, check-out and the costs for breakfast and parking. 

1. When I choose a place to spend my valuable free time, I let myself be guided by experiences of others. Testimonials and guest reviews are the most important for me.
This in combination with appealing images really thrives my decision-making process. Links to social media like facebook, tripadvisor etc are key.

1. As an older person who is not the best with technology, it is very important that the website is easy and simple to use. I have just learned how to use a tablet so it's important that the website functions well on tablets.
The more intuitive the website is, the more likely I will be to book the property. I like to make a reservation directly with the property so I don't want to have to look too long in order to find the contact details of the property.

### Site owners Goals
* Advertise Bed & Breakfast and all its features
* Increase bookings
* Stand out from the competition
